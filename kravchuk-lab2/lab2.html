            <h2>About me</h2>
        </div>
        <p> My name Maria and I am a second-year student at the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv at the Faculty
            of
            Applied Mathematics and Informatics, majoring in System Analysis. My studies gave me a
            strong foundation in communication, leadership skills, programming such as Python,C++,C#, and
            mathematics such as mathematic analysis. In order to be more competent in this field, I constantly try to
            learn new principles and technologies from various online courses. Also, I like to be a leader
            and be an active public figure, so at school I was a member of the city student parliament, and
            now I am a member of the student council of the faculty</p>
